                <p>My research is currently focused on the special holonomy 
                manifolds arising in M-theory Minkowski flux compactifications from 11d to 4d.  
                I use the tools of Exceptional Generalised Geometry to study the internal seven 
                dimensional manifold.  In general I am interested in the geometries of physics, 
                high energy or otherwise.  In the summer of 2018 I completed a long project with 
                Prof. Mihalis Dafermos on the Cauchy problem in General Relativity, 
                in which I produced some "bridge the gap" lecture notes between a graduate 
                General Relativity course and the theory of Partial Differential Equations.</p>

                <p>
                I have an MMath from the University of Cambridge, 
                graduating with a Distinction in 2019.  
                I was awarded the Vice Chancellor award for academic performance and promise, 
                alongside earlier David Thouless and Community contribution awards.
